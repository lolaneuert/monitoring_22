### EU-FOREST DATA '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
### information on the dataset from the authors
# "EU-Forest greatly extends the publicly available information on the distribution of European tree species 
# by adding almost half a million of tree occurrences derived from National Forest Inventories for 21 countries in Europe. 
# The improvement is not only concerning the number of occurrences but also the taxonomy including more than 200 tree species. 
# The reliability of the dataset is ensured by the fact that all surveys have been carried out by trained professional 
# staff using standard protocols. Nevertheless, we performed a technical validation aimed at detecting potential outliers, 
# and we evaluated the overall biogeographical consistency with well established knowledge. 
# Although, this dataset was originally designed to provide European decision-makers with high-quality forest data, 
# we believe that the great improvement in forest occurrences, taxonomy and spatial coverage will most likely benefit several disciplines 
# including forestry, biodiversity conservation, palaeoecology, plant ecology, the bioeconomy, and pest management."
