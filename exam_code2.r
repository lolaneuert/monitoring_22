### EU-FOREST DATA '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
### information on the dataset from the authors
# "EU-Forest greatly extends the publicly available information on the distribution of European tree species 
# by adding almost half a million of tree occurrences derived from National Forest Inventories for 21 countries in Europe. 
# The improvement is not only concerning the number of occurrences but also the taxonomy including more than 200 tree species. 
# The reliability of the dataset is ensured by the fact that all surveys have been carried out by trained professional 
# staff using standard protocols. Nevertheless, we performed a technical validation aimed at detecting potential outliers, 
# and we evaluated the overall biogeographical consistency with well established knowledge. 
# Although, this dataset was originally designed to provide European decision-makers with high-quality forest data, 
# we believe that the great improvement in forest occurrences, taxonomy and spatial coverage will most likely benefit several disciplines 
# including forestry, biodiversity conservation, palaeoecology, plant ecology, the bioeconomy, and pest management."

### CORRELATION''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
# to correlate the different data sets we extract the values for each at the location where a pine is found
# we want to extract the exact elevation data for the points where the pine is found
DEM_pinus <- extract (dem_alps, dat_pinus_cembra)
# we want to extract the exact soil water data for the points where the pine is found
SWI_pinus <- extract (swi_crop_alps, dat_pinus_cembra)
# we want to extract the exact land surface temperature data for the points where the pine is found
LST_pinus <- extract (lst_crop_alps, dat_pinus_cembra)

# we create a new list, containing the coordinates of the point tree data
Pinus_point_data <- tree_occ_pinus_cembra[c(1,2,4)]
# to have some orientation we create a sequence of numbers 1:346
nr <- seq(from = 1, to = 346)
# we bind together the point data of the pine with the extracted DEM, SWI and LST data
Pinus <- cbind(nr, Pinus_point_data, DEM_pinus, SWI_pinus, LST_pinus)

# one can see that several columns contain NA data, especially in the LST data
# to be able to compute statistically with these values, the NA columns need to be removed
Pinus_clean <- na.omit(Pinus) # remove all columns which contain NAs, we are left with 149 of originally 346 pine observations
# some of the omissions were due to pine observations outside of the alpine region, whist most were due to missing data in one or more of the environmental rasters

# for the actual correlation a pearson test is conducted
# it is assumed that land surface temperature is negatively correlated with digital elevation 
# whilst land surface temperature is positively correlated with soil water index
# lastly it is assumed that digital elevation is negatively correlated with soil water index
cor.test(Pinus_clean$LST_pinus, Pinus_clean$DEM_pinus, alternative = "less")
cor.test(Pinus_clean$LST_pinus, Pinus_clean$SWI_pinus, alternative = "greater")
cor.test(Pinus_clean$DEM_pinus, Pinus_clean$SWI_pinus, alternative = "less")

# none of the above tests of correlation showed a p-value below 0.05 so there are doubts concerning there relevancy
# ... results?? scatterplots??

# which of the parameters shows larger range, more precise vales at points? in total/in points of pine occurrence?
# this could lead to assumptions about which of them is more relevant for the occurrence of pine
# boxplots of what values are available, and what values are shown at pine points
